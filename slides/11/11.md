# Linear Algebra Refresh – Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Let $⇉A ∈ ℂ^{N×M}$ be an $N×M$ matrix.

~~~
- A vector $→v ∈ ℂ^M$ is a (right) **eigenvector**, if there exists an
  **eigenvalue** $λ ∈ ℂ$,
  such that
  $$⇉A →v = λ →v.$$

~~~
- If $⇉A ∈ ℝ^{N×N}$ is a real symmetric matrix, than it has $N$ real
  eigenvalues and $N$ real eigenvectors, which can be chosen to be _orthonormal_,
  and we can express $⇉A$ using the **eigenvalue decomposition**
  $$⇉A = ⇉V^T ⇉Λ ⇉V,$$
  where:
~~~
  - $⇉V$ is a matrix, whose columns are the eigenvectors $→v_1, →v_2, …, →v_N$;
~~~
  - $⇉Λ$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues $λ_1, λ_2, …, λ_N$ on the diagonal.

# Linear Algebra Refresh – Positive Definiteness

Let $⇉A ∈ ℝ^{N×N}$ be a real symmetric matrix. Then
if for all $→x ≠ →0$:
~~~
- $→x^T ⇉A →x > 0$, the matrix is called **positive definite**.

~~~
  Note that this condition is equivalent to all eigenvalues being **positive**.

~~~
- $→x^T ⇉A →x ≥ 0$, the matrix is called **positive semi-definite**.

  This condition is equivalent to all eigenvalues being **non-negative**.

~~~
- $→x^T ⇉A →x < 0$, the matrix is called **negative definite**.

  This condition is equivalent to all eigenvalues being **negative**.

~~~
- $→x^T ⇉A →x ≤ 0$, the matrix is called **negative semi-definite**.

  This condition is equivalent to all eigenvalues being **non-positive**.

~~~
Note that we can compute a “square root” of a positive (semi-)definite matrix,
because if $⇉A = ⇉V^T ⇉Λ ⇉V$, then for $⇉Λ^{1/2} ⇉V$ we get
$$(⇉Λ^{1/2} ⇉V)^T ⇉Λ^{1/2} ⇉V = ⇉V^T ⇉Λ^{1/2} ⇉Λ^{1/2} ⇉V = ⇉V^T ⇉Λ ⇉V = ⇉A.$$

section: PCA
# Principal Component Analysis

The **principal component analysis**, **PCA**, is a linear transformation used for
- dimensionality reduction,
- feature extraction,
- whitening,
- data visualization.

~~~
To motivate the dimensionality reduction, consider a dataset consisting
of a randomly translated and rotated image.

![w=100%,h=center](manifold_example.png)

~~~
Every member of the dataset can be described just by three quantities –
horizontal and vertical offsets and a rotation. We usually say that the
_data lie on a manifold of dimension three_.

---
# Principal Component Analysis

We start by defining the PCA in two ways.

~~~
![w=40%,f=right](pca_variance.svgz)

## Maximum Variance Formulation

Given data $→x_1, …, →x_N$ with $→x_i ∈ ℝ^D$, the goal is to project
them to a space with dimensionality $M < D$, so that the variance
of their projection is maximal.

~~~
We start by considering a projection to one-dimensional space. Such a projection
is defined by a vector $→u_1$, and because only the direction of $→u_1$ matters,
we assume that $→u_1^T →u_1 = 1$.

~~~
The projection of $→x_i$ to $→u_1$ is given by $(→u_1^T →x_i) →u_1$, because the
vectors $→u_1$ and $→x_i - (→u_1^T →x_i) →u_1$ are orthogonal:

$$→u_1^T \big(→x_i - (→u_1^T →x_i) →u_1\big) = →u_1^T →x_i - (→u_1^T →x_i) →u_1^T →u_1 = 0.$$

---
# Principal Component Analysis

We therefore use $→u_1^T →x_i$ as the projection of $→x_i$. If we define
$→x̄ = ∑_i →x_i / N$, the mean of the projected data is $→u_1^T →x̄$ and the
variance is given by
$$\frac{1}{N} ∑_{i=1}^N \big(→u_1^T →x_i - →u_1^T →x̄\big)^2 = →u_1^T ⇉S →u_1,$$
where $⇉S$ is the data covariance matrix defined as
$$⇉S = \frac{1}{N} ∑_{i=1}^N \big(→x_i - →x̄\big)\big(→x_i - →x̄)^T.$$

~~~
We can write the data covariance matrix in matrix form as
$⇉S = \frac{1}{N} \big(⇉X - →x̄\big)^T \big(⇉X - →x̄\big)$.

If the original data is centered (it has zero mean), then
$⇉S = \frac{1}{N} ⇉X^T ⇉X$, which we have already encountered.

---
# Principal Component Analysis

To maximize $→u_1^T ⇉S →u_1$, we need to include the constraint $→u_1^T →u_1$ by
introducing a Lagrange multiplier $λ_1$ for the constraint $→u_1^T →u_1 - 1 = 0$
and then maximizing the Lagrangian
$$𝓛 = →u_1^T ⇉S →u_1 - λ_1\big(→u_1^T →u_1 - 1\big).$$

~~~
By computing a derivative with respect to $→u_1$, we get
$$⇉S →u_1 = λ_1 →u_1.$$

~~~
Therefore, $→u_1$ must be an eigenvector of $⇉S$ corresponding to eigenvalue
$λ_1$.

~~~
Because the value to maximize $→u_1^T ⇉S →u_1$ is then $→u_1^T λ_1 →u_1 = λ_1 →u_1^T →u_1 = λ_1$,
the maximum will be attained for eigenvector $→u_1$ corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue $λ_1$.

~~~
The eigenvector $→u_1$ is known as the **first principal component**.

~~~
For a given $M$, the principal components are eigenvectors corresponding
to $M$ largest eigenvalues, and maximize the variance of the projected data.

# Principal Component Analysis

## Minimum Error Formulation

Assume $→u_1, …, →u_D$ is some orthonormal set of vectors, therefore,
$→u_i^T →u_j = \big[i == j\big]$.

~~~
Every $→x_i$ can be then expressed using this basis as
$$→x_i = ∑_j \big(→x_i^T →u_j) →u_j,$$
using a similar argument as the one we used to derive the orthogonal projection.

~~~
Because we want to eventually represent the data using $M$ dimensions, we will
approximate the data by the first $M$ basis vectors:
$$→x̃_i = ∑_{j=1}^M z_{i,j} →u_j + ∑_{j=M+1}^D b_j →u_j.$$

---
# Principal Component Analysis

We now choose the vectors $→u_j$, coordinates $z_{i,j}$ and biases $b_j$ to
minimize the approximation error, which we measure as a loss
$$L = \frac{1}{N} ∑\nolimits_{i=1}^N \|→x_i - →x̃_i\|^2.$$

~~~
To minimize the error, we compute the derivative of $L$ with respect to
$z_{i,j}$ and $b_j$, and utilizing the orthogonality, we obtain
$$z_{i,j} = →x_i^T →u_j,~~~~b_j = →x̄^T →u_j.$$

~~~
Therefore, we can rewrite the loss as
$$L = \frac{1}{N} ∑_{i=1}^N ∑_{j=M+1}^D (→x_i^T →u_j - →x̄^T →u_j)^2 = ∑_{j=M+1}^D →u_j^T ⇉S →u_j.$$

~~~
Analogously, we can minimize $L$ by choosing the eigenvectors of $D-M$
smallest eigenvalues.

# PCA Applications – Data Compression

We can represent the data $→x_i$ by the approximations $→x̃_i$
$$ →x̃_i = ∑_{j=1}^M \big(→x_i^T →u_j\big) →u_j + ∑_{j=M+1}^D \big(→x̄^T →u_j\big) →u_j
        = →x̄ + ∑_{j=1}^M \big(→x_i^T →u_j - →x̄^T →u_j\big)→u_j.$$

# PCA Applications – Whitening aka Sphering

The PCA formula allows us to perform **whitening** aka **sphering**, which is
a linear transformation of the given data, so that the resulting dataset
has zero mean and an identity covariance matrix.

~~~
Notably, if $⇉U$ are the eigenvectors of $⇉S$ and $⇉Λ$ is the diagonal matrix of
the corresponding eigenvalues (i.e., $⇉S ⇉U = ⇉U ⇉Λ$), we can define the
transformed data as
$$→z_i ≝ ⇉Λ^{-1/2} ⇉U^T (→x_i - →x̄).$$

~~~
Then, the mean of $→z_i$ is zero and the covariance is given by
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{N} ∑_i →z_i →z_i^T
  &= \frac{1}{N} ∑_i ⇉Λ^{-1/2} ⇉U^T (→x_i - →x̄) (→x_i - →x̄)^T ⇉U ⇉Λ^{-1/2} \\
  &= ⇉Λ^{-1/2} ⇉U^T ⇉S ⇉U ⇉Λ^{-1/2} = ⇉Λ^{-1/2} ⇉Λ ⇉Λ^{-1/2} = ⇉I.
\end{aligned}$$

# PCA versus Supervised ML

Note that PCA does not have access to supervised labels, so it may not
give a solution favorable for further classification.

# Principal Component Analysis and MLPs

![w=40%,h=center](pca_ae.svgz)

It can be proven that if we construct a MLP _autoencoder_,
which is a model trying to reconstruct input as close as possible,
then even if the hidden layer uses non-linear activation, the solution
to a MSE loss is a projection onto the $M$-dimensional subspace defined
by the first $M$ principal components (but is not necessary orthonormal
or orthogonal).

---
# Principal Component Analysis and MLPs

However, non-linear PCA can be achieved, if both the _encoder_ and the _decoder_
are non-linear.

![w=70%,h=center](pca_ae_nonlinear.svgz)

# Computing PCA

There are two frequently used algorithms for performing PCA.

~~~
If we want to compute all (or many) principal components, we can compute
directly the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.

~~~
We can even avoid computing the covariance matrix. If we instead compute the
singular value decomposition of $(⇉X - →x̄) = ⇉U ⇉D ⇉V^T$, it holds that
$$\big(⇉X - →x̄\big)^T \big(⇉X - →x̄\big) = ⇉V ⇉D ⇉U^T ⇉U ⇉D ⇉V^T = ⇉V ⇉D^2 ⇉V^T.$$

~~~
Therefore, 
$$\big(⇉X - →x̄\big)^T \big(⇉X - →x̄\big) ⇉V = ⇉V ⇉D^2,$$
which means that $⇉V$ are the eigenvectors of $(⇉X-→x̄)^T (⇉X-→x̄)$ and therefore
of the data covariance matrix $⇉S$. The eigenvalues of $⇉S$ are the squares of
the singular values of $(⇉X-→x̄)$ divided by $N$.

section: PowerIteration
# Computing PCA — The Power Iteration Algorithm

If we want only the first (or several first) principal components, we might use
the **power iteration algorithm**.

~~~
The power iteration algorithm can be used to find a **dominant** eigenvalue (an
eigenvalue with absolute value strictly larger than absolute value of all other
eigenvalues) and the corresponding eigenvector (it is used for example to
compute PageRank). It works as follows:

<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Real symmetric matrix $⇉A$ with a dominant eigenvalue.<br>
**Output**: The dominant eigenvalue $λ$ and the corresponding eigenvector $→v$, with
probability close to 1.

- Initialize $v$ randomly (for example each component from $U[-1,1]$).
~~~
- Repeat until convergence (or for a fixed number of iterations):
  - $→v ← ⇉A→v$
  - $λ ← \|→v\|$
  - $→v ← →v / λ$
</div>

~~~
If the algorithm converges, then $→v = ⇉A→v / λ$, so $→v$ is an eigenvector with
eigenvalue $λ$.

---
class: dbend
# Computing PCA — The Power Iteration Algorithm

In order to analyze the convergence, let $(λ_1, λ_2, λ_3, …)$ be the eigenvalues
of $⇉A$, in the descending order of absolute values, so $|λ_1| > |λ_2| ≥ |λ_3| ≥ …$,
where the strict equality is the consequence of the dominant eigenvalue
assumption.

~~~
If we express the vector $→v$ in the basis of the eigenvectors as
$(a_1, a_2, a_3, …)$, then $⇉A→v / λ_1$ is in the basis of the eigenvectors:
$$\frac{⇉A→v}{λ_1}
  = \left(\frac{λ_1}{λ_1}a_1, \frac{λ_2}{λ_1}a_2, \frac{λ_3}{λ_1}a_3, …\right)
  = \left(               a_1, \frac{λ_2}{λ_1}a_2, \frac{λ_3}{λ_1}a_3, …\right).$$

~~~
Therefore, all but the first coordinates decreased by at least a factor of
$|λ_2/λ_1|$.

~~~
If the initial $→v$ had a non-zero first coordinate $a_1$ (which has probability
very close to 1), then repeated multiplication with $⇉A$ will converge to the
eigenvector corresponding to $λ_1$.

---
# Computing PCA — The Power Iteration Algorithm

After we get the largest eigenvalue $λ_1$ and its eigenvector $→v_1$, we can modify the
matrix $⇉A$ to “remove the eigenvalue $λ_1$”.
~~~
Considering $⇉A - λ_1 →v_1 →v_1^T$:
- mutiplying it by $→v_1$ returns zero:
  $$\big(⇉A - λ_1 →v_1 →v_1^T\big) →v_1 = λ_1 →v_1 - λ_1 →v_1 \underbrace{→v_1^T →v_1}_{1} = 0,$$
~~~
- mutiplying it by other eigenvectors $→v_i$ gives the same result as
  multiplying $⇉A$:
  $$\big(⇉A - λ_1 →v_1 →v_1^T\big) →v_i = ⇉A →v_i - λ_1 →v_1 \underbrace{→v_1^T →v_i}_{0} = ⇉A →v_i.$$

~~~
Therefore, $⇉A - λ_1 →v_1 →v_1^T$ has the same set of eigenvectors and
eigenvalues, except for $→v_1, λ_1$.

---
# Computing PCA — The Power Iteration Algorithm

We are now ready to formulate the complete algorithm for computing the PCA.

<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Matrix $⇉X$, desired number of dimensions $M$.

- Compute the mean $→μ$ of the examples (the rows of $⇉X$).

~~~
- Compute the covariance matrix $S ← \frac{1}{N} \big(⇉X - →μ\big)^T\big(⇉X - →μ\big)$.

~~~
- for $i$ in $\{1, 2, …, M\}$:
  - Initialize $→v_i$ randomly.
  - Repeat until convergence (or for a fixed number of iterations):
    - $→v_i ← ⇉S→v_i$
    - $λ_i ← \|→v_i\|$
    - $→v_i ← →v_i / λ_i$
~~~
  - $⇉S ← ⇉S - λ_i →v_i →v_i^T$
~~~
- Return $⇉X ⇉V$, where the columns of $⇉V$ are $→v_1, →v_2, …, →v_M$.
</div>

section: Clustering
# Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique, which given input
data tries to divide them into some number of groups, or **clusters**.

~~~
The number of clusters might be given in advance, or we should infer it.

~~~
When clustering documents, we usually normalize TF-IDF normalized so that each
feature vector has length 1 (i.e., L2 normalization), because then
$$1 - \operatorname{cosine~similarity}(→x, →y) = \frac{1}{2} \|→x - →y\|^2.$$

---
section: KMeans
# K-Means Clustering

Let $→x_1, →x_2, …, →x_N$ be a collection of $N$ input examples, each being
a $D$-dimensional vector $→x_i ∈ ℝ^D$. Let $K$, the number of target clusters,
be given.

~~~
Let $z_{i, k} ∈ \{0, 1\}$ be binary indicator variables describing whether an input
example $→x_i$ is assigned to cluster $k$, and let each cluster be specified by
a point $→μ_1, …, →μ_K$, usually called the cluster **center**.

~~~
Our objective function $J$, which we aim to minimize, is
$$J = ∑_{i=1}^N ∑_{k=1}^K z_{i, k} \|→x_i - →μ_k\|^2.$$

---
# K-Means Clustering

<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Input points $→x_1, …, →x_N$, number of clusters $K$.

- Initialize $→μ_1, …, →μ_K$ as $K$ random input points.

~~~
- Repeat until convergence (or until patience runs out):
~~~
  - Compute the best possible $z_{i, k}$. It is easy to see that the smallest $J$
    is achieved by
    $$z_{i,k} = \begin{cases} 1 & \textrm{~~if~}k = \argmin\nolimits_j \|→x_i - →μ_j\|^2, \\
                              0 & \textrm{~~otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

~~~
  - Compute the best possible $→μ_k = \argmin\nolimits_{→μ} ∑_i z_{i,k} \|→x_i-→μ\|^2$.
~~~
   By computing a derivative with respect to $→μ$, we get
   $$→μ_k = \frac{∑_i z_{i,k} →x_i}{∑_i z_{i,k}}.$$
</div>

# K-Means Clustering

# K-Means Clustering

![w=60%,f=right](kmeans_convergence.svgz)

It is easy to see that:
- updating the cluster assignment $z_{i, k}$ decreases the loss $J$ or keeps it the same;
~~~
- updating the cluster centers again decreases the loss $J$ or keeps it the
  same.

~~~
K-Means clustering therefore converges to a local optimum. However, it
is quite sensitive to the starting initialization:
~~~
- It is common practise to run K-Means algorithm multiple times with different
  initialization and use the result with the lowest $J$ (scikit-learn uses
  `n_init=10` by default).
~~~
- Instead of using random initialization, `k-means++` initialization scheme might
  be used, where the first cluster center is chosen randomly and others are
  chosen proportionally to the square of their distance to the nearest cluster
  center. It can be proven that with such initialization, the found solution
  has $𝓞(\log K)$ approximation ratio in expectation.
